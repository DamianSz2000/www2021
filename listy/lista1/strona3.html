    <h1>Elon Musk</h1>
    <p>Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the
        founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.;
        founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is the richest
        person in the world as of September 2021.[2]

        Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly
        attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred
        to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and
        physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business
        career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for
        $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to
        form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

        In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO
        and CTO. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and
        product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services
        company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit
        research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a
        neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a
        tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.

        Musk has been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized
        controversies. In 2018, he was sued for defamation by a British caver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue;
        a California jury ruled in favor of Musk. In the same year, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange
        Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled
        with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage.
        Musk has spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from experts for his other
        views on such matters as artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and public transport.

    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <h3>Childhood and family</h3>
    <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[3] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman),
        a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[4][5][6] but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol
        Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer.[7] Musk has
        a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[6][8] His maternal grandfather,
        Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian,[9][10] and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch
        ancestry.[11][12] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and
        elsewhere,[11] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[13] Musk has become
        estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could
        possibly think of, he has done."[13] He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.[9][14]

        Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20.[15][16]
        He learned computer programming using a manual and, by age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he
        created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[17][18] An awkward and
        introverted child,[19] Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys
        threw him down a flight of stairs.[13][20] He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High
        School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.[21]
